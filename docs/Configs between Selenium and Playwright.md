In **Selenium**, there isn't a direct equivalent to Playwright's `playwright.config.ts`, but the concept of global test configuration can be achieved using a combination of several tools and strategies. Here's how the configuration in Selenium compares to `playwright.config.ts`:

### **1. Global Configuration (like `playwright.config.ts`)**

In Selenium, you typically handle global configuration using one or more of the following:

- **TestNG or JUnit Configuration:** These are the most common ways to manage configuration in a Java-based Selenium project. You can define timeouts, retries, parallel execution, and test parameters in the configuration files (e.g., `testng.xml` for TestNG or annotations for JUnit).

- **WebDriver Setup:** The configuration for which browsers to run the tests on (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and other WebDriver settings (headless mode, timeouts, etc.) are often done in the test setup code or in configuration files like `testng.xml`.

- **DesiredCapabilities (or Options):** These are used to configure specific properties for the browser (such as headless mode, screen size, browser version, etc.). For example, you use `ChromeOptions`, `FirefoxOptions`, or `EdgeOptions` to set browser-specific configurations.

### **2. Parallel Execution and Retries**

Both **Playwright** and **Selenium** can run tests in parallel, but the configurations are handled differently:

- In **Playwright**, parallel execution and retries can be configured directly in `playwright.config.ts` under the `projects` array and global settings.
- In **Selenium**, parallel execution is typically set up in TestNG using `<suite>` and `<test>` tags in `testng.xml`. Retries can be configured using **Listeners** or **ITestListener** implementations.

Example **TestNG parallel execution setup** in `testng.xml`:

```xml
<suite name="Suite" parallel="tests" thread-count="2">
    <test name="Test1">
        <classes>
            <class name="Test1" />
        </classes>
    </test>
    <test name="Test2">
        <classes>
            <class name="Test2" />
        </classes>
    </test>
</suite>
```

### **3. Timeouts and Waits**

In **Playwright**, timeouts, waits, and other behaviors are often configured globally in the `playwright.config.ts` file.

In **Selenium**, you handle timeouts and waits through **WebDriverWait**, **implicitlyWait**, or through the configuration in the test framework (TestNG/JUnit):

- `driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);`
- `WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);`

### **4. Browser Configuration (Headless Mode, Device Emulation)**

In **Playwright**, this is set in the `use` section of `playwright.config.ts` where you can define browsers, devices, and other settings for each project.

In **Selenium**, you define this using browser-specific options. For example, setting headless mode or device emulation in **Chrome**:

```java
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.addArguments("--headless");  // Running Chrome in headless mode
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);
```

For device emulation, Selenium does not provide a built-in feature similar to Playwrightâ€™s `devices` setup, but you can use Chrome DevTools Protocol or third-party libraries for device simulation.

### **5. Reporting**

In **Playwright**, you can configure reporters (e.g., HTML, dot) to log test results in `playwright.config.ts`.

In **Selenium**, you often use **TestNG** or **JUnit** for reporting, combined with reporters like **ExtentReports** or **Allure**. These tools help you capture detailed logs and test reports.

For example, setting up an **ExtentReports** reporter in Selenium:

```java
ExtentReports extent = new ExtentReports();
ExtentTest test = extent.createTest("Sample Test");
```

### **6. Setup and Teardown**

In **Playwright**, you define `globalSetup` and `globalTeardown` functions for setup and teardown tasks across all tests.

In **Selenium**, this can be managed in **TestNG** or **JUnit** through `@BeforeSuite`, `@AfterSuite`, `@BeforeTest`, and `@AfterTest` annotations.

Example in **TestNG**:

```java
@BeforeSuite
public void setUp() {
    // Global setup logic
}

@AfterSuite
public void tearDown() {
    // Global teardown logic
}
```

### **Summary of Comparison**

| **Playwright Config**                                   | **Selenium Config**                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Global settings** (e.g., timeouts, retries, base URL) | Handled in `testng.xml`, `@BeforeSuite`, `@BeforeTest`, or in WebDriver setup                |
| **Test projects** (for different browsers, devices)     | Handled using browser-specific options like `ChromeOptions`, `FirefoxOptions`, `EdgeOptions` |
| **Parallel execution**                                  | Configured in `testng.xml` for TestNG or `@Test` annotations in JUnit                        |
| **Retries**                                             | Implemented with listeners in TestNG or custom retry logic in JUnit                          |
| **Reporting**                                           | Handled with reporters like ExtentReports, Allure, or built-in TestNG/JUnit reporting        |
| **Setup/Teardown**                                      | Handled with TestNG annotations or JUnit setup/teardown methods                              |

### Conclusion:

While **Selenium** does not have a single configuration file like **Playwright's `playwright.config.ts`**, it provides similar functionality through a combination of test frameworks (TestNG/JUnit), WebDriver options, listeners, and reporters. Playwright's `playwright.config.ts` is a more centralized place for configuration, while in Selenium, configurations are typically spread across various places like `testng.xml`, WebDriver setup code, and test classes.
